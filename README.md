## Description
This is a base program that can be used for an e-commerce backend to store product data. We also created associations between the product, category and tag ids to keep track of stock.

We are utilizing dotenv, express, mysql and sequelize packages to run the program.

The most difficult part of the project was to set up the routes as well as the logics to CRUD the desired data.
